Yet another plugin inspired by Hello Dolly. This plugin shows information about the 88 constellations and their stars that are most visible given your location, date and time.

== Description ==
Inspired by Hello Dolly, this plugin works as a reminder of which constellation/star is visible for the current month.
It shows information about the 88 officially recognized constellations by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).
If a constellation has one of the 28 brightest stars, the line shown is designated with an '*'.
It is a nice reminder for astronomy amateur developers like myself who wants to be reminded of the constellations and stars that are most visible in a given month.
You can view Nasa's Picture of the Day, control the color of text and background in the 'Hello Star' settings page under "Settings" menu.

I am using NASA API demo_key for retrieving the daily Picture of the Day (apod) image. The demo key has a very low rate limits, if you want to keep apod, I recommend you get your own API key as described here:

For suggestions to make this plugin any better, you can find me on twitter at (http://twitter.com/sarahphp1).
